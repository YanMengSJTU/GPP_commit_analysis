+# Skype4J
+
+This is a Skype API for Java. It currently does not support P2P chats, but plans to do so in the future (with native dependencies)
+
+This is also very much a work in progress. As such, API methods are not guarenteed to remain the same. However, if you stay out of the `com.samczsun.skype4j.internal` package you should be good
+
+Here is an example of this API in action
+
+```java
+Skype skype = SkypeClient.create(username, password).client(Client.WEB).login();
+skype.getEventDispatcher().registerListener(new Listener() {
+  @EventHandler
+  public void onMessage(MessageReceivedEvent e) {
+    System.out.println("Got message: " + e.getMessage().getMessage());
+  }
+});
+skype.subscribe();
+```
