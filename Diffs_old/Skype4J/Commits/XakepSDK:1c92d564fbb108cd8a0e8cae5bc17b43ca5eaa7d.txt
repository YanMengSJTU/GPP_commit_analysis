 # Skype4J
 
-This is a Skype API for Java. It currently does not support P2P chats, but plans to do so in the future (with native dependencies)
+This is a Skype API for Java. It does not support P2P chats. You can tell whether you're in a P2P chat or not based on the output of the `/help` command. If it contains commands such as `/kickban`, you're in a P2P chat and should switch to cloud chats immediately (try using `/fork`)
 
 This is also very much a work in progress. As such, API methods are not guarenteed to remain the same. However, if you stay out of the `com.samczsun.skype4j.internal` package you should be good
