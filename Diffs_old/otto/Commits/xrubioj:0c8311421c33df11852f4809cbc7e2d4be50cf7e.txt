+Improvements in this fork
+-------------------------
+
+This fork contains a patch to allow Subscribers and Producers in a superclass. Otto doesn't allow that for performance reasons, but to overcome this we use InheritSubscribers annotation in the derived class. In case we find this annotation, we keep looking for Subscribers and Producers in the parent class.
+
+As a safety measure, if the parent class is an Android or Java libraries class, we stop the recursion with an exception. This will mean that the developer has annotated a direct subclass of an Android or Java libraries class (most likely an Activity or a Fragment) with InheritSubscribers. As those classes are pretty big, the processing will take too long, and we're pretty sure we will not find annotations in that classes.
+
+This fork is based on work by Kamil Wisniewski https://github.com/thirogit/otto.
