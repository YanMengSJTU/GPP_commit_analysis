 Cancelling further event delivery
 ---------------------------------
-*TODO. For now, this is just the javadoc for the method cancelEventDelivery(Object event):*
+You have 2 options: 
+*cancelEventDelivery(Object event):*
 Called from a subscriber's event handling method, further event delivery will be canceled. Subsequent subscribers won't receive the event. Events are usually canceled by higher priority subscribers (see register(Object, int)). Canceling is restricted to event handling methods running in posting thread ThreadMode.PostThread.
 
+*cancelEvent(AbstractEvent event):*
+This will only work if the mode you are trying to cancel is AsyncTracked.

 Sticky Events
 -------------
 Some events carry information that is of interest after the event is posted. For example, this could be an event signalizing that some initialization is complete. Or if you have some sensor or location data and you want to hold on the most recent values. Instead of implementing your own caching, you can use sticky events. EventBus keeps the last sticky event of a certain type in memory. The sticky event can be delivered to subscribers or queried explicitly. Thus, you don't need any special logic to consider already available data.
