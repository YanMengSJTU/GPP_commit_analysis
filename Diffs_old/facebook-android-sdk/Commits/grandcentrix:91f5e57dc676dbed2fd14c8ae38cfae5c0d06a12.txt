+         source.dir
+             The name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.

+
+         For other overridable properties, look at the beginning of the rules
+         files in the SDK, at tools/ant/build.xml
+
+         Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should
+         be updated using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

+         This file is an integral part of the build system for your

+         To customize existing targets, there are two options:

+             - copy/paste the target into this file, *before* the
+               <import> task.
+             - customize it to your needs.
+         - Customize the whole content of build.xml
+             - copy/paste the content of the rules files (minus the top node)
+               into this file, replacing the <import> task.
+             - customize to your needs.
+
+         ***********************
+         ****** IMPORTANT ******
+         ***********************
+         In all cases you must update the value of version-tag below to read 'custom' instead of an integer,
+         in order to avoid having your file be overridden by tools such as "android update project"
+    -->
