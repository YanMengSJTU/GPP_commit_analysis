 When an operation fails, a failure method is called. This is `connectFailed()` for failures while building a connection to the server, and `callFailed()` when the HTTP call fails permanently. When a failure happens it is possible that a `start` event won’t have a corresponding `end` event.

 A single HTTP call may require follow-up requests to be made to handle authentication challenges, redirects, and HTTP-layer timeouts. In such cases multiple connections, requests, and responses may be attempted. Follow-ups are another reason a single call may trigger multiple events of the same type.

 Interceptors can be chained. Suppose you have both a compressing interceptor and a checksumming interceptor: you'll need to decide whether data is compressed and then checksummed, or checksummed and then compressed. OkHttp uses lists to track interceptors, and interceptors are called in order.
