+R8 / ProGuard
+=====
+
+If you use OkHttp as a dependency in an Android project which uses R8 as
+a default compiler you don't have to do anything.
+The specific rules are [already bundled](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/okhttp3.pro) into the JAR which can be interpreted by R8 automatically.
+
+If you, however, don't use R8 you have to apply the rules from [this file](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/okhttp3.pro).
+You might also need rules from [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio/) which is a dependency of this library.
