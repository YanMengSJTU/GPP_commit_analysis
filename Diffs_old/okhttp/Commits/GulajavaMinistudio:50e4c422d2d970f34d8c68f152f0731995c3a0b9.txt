 When your requested URL has moved, the webserver will return a response code like `302` to indicate the document’s new URL. OkHttp will follow the redirect to retrieve a final response.
 
-If the response issues an authorization challenge, OkHttp will ask the [`Authenticator`](http://square.github.io/okhttp/api/okhttp/okhttp3/-authenticator/) (if one is configured) to satisfy the challenge. If the authenticator supplies a credential, the request is retried with that credential included.

If the authenticator supplies a credential, the request is retried with that credential included.
 
 ## Retrying Requests
 
 Sometimes connections fail: either a pooled connection was stale and disconnected, or the webserver itself couldn’t be reached. OkHttp will retry the request with a different route if one is available.

+## [Calls](http://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-call/)
 
 With rewrites, redirects, follow-ups and retries, your simple request may yield many requests and responses. OkHttp uses `Call` to model the task of satisfying your request through however many intermediate requests and responses are necessary. Typically this isn’t many! But it’s comforting to know that your code will continue to work if your URLs are redirected or if you failover to an alternate IP address.
 
 Calls are executed in one of two ways:
 
  * **Synchronous:** your thread blocks until the response is readable.
- * **Asynchronous:** you enqueue the request on any thread, and get [called back](http://square.github.io/okhttp/api/okhttp/okhttp3/-callback/) on another thread when the response is readable.

 For synchronous calls, you bring your own thread and are responsible for managing how many simultaneous requests you make. Too many simultaneous connections wastes resources; too few harms latency.
