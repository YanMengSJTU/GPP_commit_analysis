  * pools. Reusing connections and threads reduces latency and saves memory. Conversely, creating a
  * client for each request wastes resources on idle pools.

+ *  Client应该是单例的，每个client维持着自己的连接池和线程池，共用可以减少延迟，节省内存，
  * <p>Use {@code new OkHttpClient()} to create a shared instance with the default settings:
