 OkHttp 3.x Change Log
 =====================
 
+## Version 3.14.4

+
+ *  Fix: Cancel calls that fail due to unexpected exceptions. We had a bug where an enqueued call
+    would never call back if it crashed with an unchecked throwable, such as a
+    `NullPointerException` or `OutOfMemoryError`. We now call `Callback.onFailure()` with an
+    `IOException` that reports the call as canceled. The triggering exception is still delivered to
+    the thread's `UncaughtExceptionHandler`.
+ *  Fix: Don't evict incomplete entries when iterating the cache. We had a bug where iterating
+    `Cache.urls()` would prevent in-flight entries from being written.
