-liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
-or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
-out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
-damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
-any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
-been advised of the possibility of such damages.

-==========================
+# android-proguard-snippets
 
-Example Proguard configurations for common Android libraries.
+## Installation
 
-This project assumes that your ProGuard configuration is based off of the latest official [proguard-android.txt](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/HEAD/files/proguard-android.txt) config as shown below. Each library configuration should only be the rules required for that specific library, not a complete Android ProGuard configuration. The various library configurations are combined by the Gradle build system. The library rules should be universal, any app specific rules (such as preserving model classes) should be added in a custom `proguard-project.pro` file.
+via jcenter
 
-Request additional libraries through issues. Pull requests are welcome.
+```gradle
+repositories {
+    jcenter()

+dependencies {
