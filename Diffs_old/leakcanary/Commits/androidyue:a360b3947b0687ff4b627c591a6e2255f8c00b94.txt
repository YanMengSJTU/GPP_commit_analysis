 * if `leakcanary-android` is not in the list of external libraries in Android Studio, but `leakcanary-analyzer` and `leakcanary-watcher` are there: try doing a `Clean Build`. If it's still a problem, try building from the command line.
 * `error: package com.squareup.leakcanary does not exist`: if you have other build types than `debug` and `release`, you need to add a specific dependency for those too (`xxxCompile`).
+* If you set the targetSdkVersion as API 23(Marshmallow), Please do support the Runtime Permission in your host application.
