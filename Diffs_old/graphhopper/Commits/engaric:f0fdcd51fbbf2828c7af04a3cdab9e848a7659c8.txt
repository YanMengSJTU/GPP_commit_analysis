+  Scenario Outline: Verify  waypoints on a Route for nearest point for car if the private is set to false
+    Given I have route point as
+      | pointA              | pointB              |
+      | 50.984261,-0.616646 | 50.983864,-0.611073 |
+    And I have vehicle as "<vehicleType>"
+    And I have weighting as "<routeType>"
+    And I have private as "false"
+    When I request for a route
+    Then I should be able to verify the waypoints on the route map:
+      | wayPointIndex | waypointco          | waypointdesc                        | azimuth | direction | time | distance | avoidance |
