+# Elevation
+
+Per default elevation is disabled. But you can easily enable it:
+`graph.elevation.provider=cgiar`
+or
+`graph.elevation.provider=srtm`
+
+then GraphHopper will automatically download the necessary data for the area and include elevation 
+for all vehicles - making also the distances a bit more precise. 
+
+The default cache directory (/tmp/srtm) will be used. For large areas it is highly recommended to 
+use a SSD disc, thus you need to specify the cache directory:
+`graph.elevation.cachedir=/myssd/ele_cache/`
+
+## What to download and where to store it? 
+
+All should work automatically. Another setting is to specify the location where the files are 
+downloaded - e.g. if the servers are not reachable, then you set:
+`graph.elevation.baseurl`
+
+E.g. for CGIAR there are two URLs you can use: `http://droppr.org/srtm/v4.1/6_5x5_TIFs` and
+`http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRT-ZIP/SRTM_V41/SRTM_Data_GeoTiff/`
+where the last one is only accessibly if you specify the 
+[full zip file](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRT-ZIP/SRTM_V41/SRTM_Data_GeoTiff/srtm_01_02.zip)
+
+If the area is small and you need a faster import you can change the default MMAP setting to:
+`graph.elevation.dataaccess=RAM_STORE`
+
+## CGIAR vs. SRTM
+
+The CGIAR data is preferred because of the quality but is in general not public domain. 
+But we got a license for our and our users' usage: https://graphhopper.com/public/license/CGIAR.txt
+
+Using SRTM instead CGIAR has the minor advantage of a faster download, especially for smaller areas.
+
+## Custom Elevation Data
+
+Integrating your own elevation data is easy and just requires you to implement the
+ElevationProvider interface and then specify it via GraphHopper.setElevationProvider.
+Have a look in the existing implementations for a simple overview of caching and DataAccess usage.
