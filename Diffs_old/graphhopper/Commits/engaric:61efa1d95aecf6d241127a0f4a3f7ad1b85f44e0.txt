+    Given I have route point as
+      | pointA              | pointB              |
+      | 51.993625,-4.899369 | 51.630076,-4.976465 |
+    And I have vehicle as "<vehicleType>"
+    And I have weighting as "<routeType>"
+    When I request for a route
+    Then I should be able to verify the waypoints on the route map:
+      | wayPointIndex | waypointco          | waypointdesc        | azimuth | direction | time | distance | avoidance   |
+      | 6             | 51.970886,-4.881752 | Continue onto Route | 239.0   | SW        | 2610 | 2.9      | InlandWater |

+    Examples: 
+      | vehicleType  | avoidances | routeType |
+      | mountainbike |            | shortest  |
