+Feature: Verify a route from A to B
+    As a user
+    I want to get a route from location A to location B using the routing service
+    And route should be the fastest route and contain the waypoints,restrictions,time and other instructions
+
+  @Routing
+  Scenario Outline: Verify  waypoints on a Route
+    Given I request a route between "<pointA>" and "<pointB>" as a "<routetype>" from RoutingAPI
+    Then I should be able to verify the waypoints on the route map:
