-# GraphHopper Route Planner
+# GraphHopper Routing Engine for The University of Windsor
 
-[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper)
+My purpose with this project was to implement a **smart navigation** component within a larger **Smart Campus** web-application to help new students adapt and feel safer on campus. As a user, you can choose from 3 routing options:
+* Fastest: that is, the shortest route.
+* Indoors: paths that go through buildings are preferred, and a penalty cost is associated with outdoor edges.
+  * Useful if you don't like Canadian winters or forgot to bring an umbrella on a rainy day.
+* Safest: prefers paths that are well-lit for students walking through campus at night.
 
-GraphHopper is a fast and memory efficient Java road routing engine released under Apache License 2.0.
-Per default it uses OpenStreetMap data but can import other data sources.
+**Note:** I've only defined indoor and well-lit paths for the University of Windsor campus, see **TODO: DOCUMENTATION** to learn how to integrate your own route data.
