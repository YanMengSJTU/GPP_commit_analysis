   Scenario Outline: Verify  waypoints on a Route
     Given I request a route between "<pointA>" and "<pointB>" as a "<routetype>" from RoutingAPI
     Then I should be able to verify the waypoints on the route map:
       | wayPointIndex | waypointco          | waypointdesc                 | azimuth | direction | time  | distance |

     Examples: 
       | pointA                                 | pointB                                 | routetype |
