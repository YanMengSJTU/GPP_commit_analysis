+Feature: Vehicle Routing Smoke Tests
+   As a user
+   I want to get a route from location A to location B using the routing service
+   And route should be the fastest route and contain the waypoints,restrictions,time and other instructions
+
+  #Error Messages
+  #Successful request
+  @Smoke
+  Scenario Outline: Successful request with all parameters
+    Given I have route <point> as
+      | pointA              | pointB              |
+      | 50.729961,-3.524853 | 50.723364,-3.523895 |
+    And I have <vehicle> as "car"
+    And I have <weighting> as "fastest"
+    And I have <locale> as "en_GB"
+    And I have <debug> as "true"
+    And I have <points_encoded> as "true"
+    And I have <calc_points> as "true"
+    And I have <instructions> as "true"
+    And I have <algorithm> as "astar"
+    And I have <type> as "json"
+    When I request for a route
+    Then I should be able to verify the http response message as "OK"
+    And I should be able to verify the http statuscode as "200"
+    And I receive a valid routing response
+
+    Examples: 
+      | point | vehicle | weighting | locale | debug | points_encoded | calc_points | instructions | algorithm | type |
+      | point | vehicle | weighting | locale | debug | points_encoded | calc_points | instructions | algorithm | type |
+      | POINT | VEHICLE | WEIGHTING | LOCALE | DEBUG | POINTS_ENCODED | CALC_POINTS | INSTRUCTIONS | ALGORITHM | TYPE |
+      | Point | Vehicle | Weighting | Locale | Debug | Points_Encoded | Calc_Points | Instructions | Algorithm | Type |
+      | POinT | VEHiCLE | WEIGHtING | LOCaLE | DEbUG | POINTs_ENCODED | CALc_POINTS | INSTRuCTIONS | ALGOrITHM | TYpE |

+    Then I should be able to verify the response message as "<errorMessage>"
+    Then I should be able to verify the statuscode as "<statusCode>"

+      | 123         |            | fastest   | Vehicle 123 is not a valid vehicle. Valid vehicles are car,emv   | 400        | Bad Request      |
+      | foot        |            | fastest   | Vehicle foot is not a valid vehicle. Valid vehicles are car,emv  | 400        | Bad Request      |
