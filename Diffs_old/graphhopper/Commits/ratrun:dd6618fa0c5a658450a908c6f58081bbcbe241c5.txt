 If you want to build GraphHopper from source look at the [Developers page](../core/quickstart-from-source.md). 
 The following steps are simpler and only need the JRE, a jar file and an OSM file.
 
- 1. Install the latest JRE and get GraphHopper Server as [zip](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/graphhopper/graphhopper-web/0.9-SNAPSHOT/) (~9MB)
+ 1. Install the latest JRE and get the zip of the [GraphHopper Web Service](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/README.md#get-started)
  2. Unzip it and copy an OSM file into the created directory. For example [berlin-latest.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin.html)
  3. Start GraphHopper Maps via: `java -jar *.jar jetty.resourcebase=webapp config=config-example.properties datareader.file=berlin-latest.osm.pbf`
  4. After you see 'Started server at HTTP 8989' go to [http://localhost:8989/](http://localhost:8989/) and you should see a map of Berlin. You should be able to click on the map and a route appears.
