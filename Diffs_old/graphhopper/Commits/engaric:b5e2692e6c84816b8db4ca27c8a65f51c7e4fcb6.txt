   Scenario Outline: Verify  Route using 2 intermediate waypoints (Oxford to Eaton via Warwick and Cambridge )
     Given I request a route between "<pointA>" and "<pointB>" as a "<routetype>" from RoutingAPI via "<pointC>" and "<pointD>"
     Then I should be able to verify the waypoints on the route map:
-      | wayPointIndex | waypointco          | waypointdesc                                     | azimuth | direction | time   | distance |
