+### Known Issues. 
+#### 1. Instant Run. 
+Instant-Run seems to prevent Sugar ORM from finding the "table" classes, therefore it cannot create the DB tables if you run the app for the first time 
+
+When running your app for the first time Turn off Instant run once to allow for the DB tables to be created
+You can enable it after the tables have been created. 
+
+To disable Instant-Run in Android Studio: 
+
+``(Preferences (Mac) or Settings (PC) -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Instant Run -> Untick "Enable Instant Run..." )``
