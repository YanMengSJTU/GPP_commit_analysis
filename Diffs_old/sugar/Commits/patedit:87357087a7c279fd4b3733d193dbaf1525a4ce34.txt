+# Sugar Cipher Changes
 
-# Getting Started:
+Add a meta property named ENCRYPTION_KEY in your manifest file along with other Sugar configuration as follows:
 
-Sugar is now available as a library project also. Add it to your project and utilize the latest changes.
-The project is available in the folder "library"
-http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects
+        <meta-data android:name="ENCRYPTION_KEY" android:value="<your own key here>" />
+        
+Include the SQLCipher libraries and assets from this link:
+https://s3.amazonaws.com/sqlcipher/SQLCipher+for+Android+v3.1.0.zip
 
-# New in version 1.2
+Extract the libs and assets into your application. This dependency is not included in the sugar library.
 
-1. package restriction for domain classes.
-2. metadata caching
-3. QueryBuilder v1
-4. Database Migrations
-5. Provision for Raw queries
-6. Better and more organized api guide and usage instructions.
+You're good to go. Use Sugar as usual and your database is encrypted now.
 
-# What's new in 1.1:
-
-1. Static api doesn't take context anymore. Hence
-
-        Book.findById(context, Book.class, 1);
-
-        becomes
-
-        Book.findById(Book.class, 1);
-
-
-2. Some cleanup in the code.
