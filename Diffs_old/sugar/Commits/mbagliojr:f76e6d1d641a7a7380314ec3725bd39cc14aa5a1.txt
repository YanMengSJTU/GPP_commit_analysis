+#Info
+This is a fork from the original Sugar Orm. I have added many of my own features and will be maintaining this project for the forseable future.
+
+##Features
+- Object relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-To-One, and Many-To-Many)
+- Specifying a custom field to be the primary key (@Id annotation)
+- Helper query methods such as findUnique and findByRelationship
+- Object Cascading
+- Lazy loading of objects
+
+##Future features
+- Eager loading of objects
+
+Let me know what features are important or bugs you encounter and I will do my best to fix them. I use this in many of my own projects and have found great success.
