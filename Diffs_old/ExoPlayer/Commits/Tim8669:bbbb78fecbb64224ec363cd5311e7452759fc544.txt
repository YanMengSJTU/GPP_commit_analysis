  * Warning - This class is marked as deprecated because there are known device specific issues
  * associated with its use, including playbacks not starting, playbacks stuttering and other
- * miscellaneous failures. For mp4, m4a, mp3, webm, mkv, mpeg-ts and aac playbacks it is strongly
- * recommended to use {@link ExtractorSampleSource} instead. Where this is not possible this class
- * can still be used, but please be aware of the associated risks. Playing container formats for
- * which an ExoPlayer extractor does not yet exist (e.g. ogg) is a valid use case of this class.
