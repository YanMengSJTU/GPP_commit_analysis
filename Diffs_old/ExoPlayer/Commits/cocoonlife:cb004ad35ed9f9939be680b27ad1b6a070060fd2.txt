-## Using ExoPlayer ##
+## Compilation
 
-The easiest way to get started using ExoPlayer is to add it as a gradle
-dependency. You need to make sure you have the jcenter repository included in
-the `build.gradle` file in the root of your project:
+Compile by entering the directory for the library project. Run ../gradlew build. An outputs directory will be created which contains library.jar. This can be copied into the libs folder of another Android studio project.
 
-```gradle
-repositories {
-    jcenter()
-}
-```
+## Modifications
 
-Next, include the following in your module's `build.gradle` file:
-
-```gradle
-compile 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:rX.X.X'
-```
-
-where `rX.X.X` is the your preferred version. For the latest version, see the
-project's [Releases][]. For more details, see the project on [Bintray][].

-## Developing ExoPlayer ##
-
-#### Project branches ####
-
-  * The project has `dev-vX` and `release-vX` branches, where `X` is the major
-    version number.
-  * Most development work happens on the `dev-vX` branch with the highest major
-    version number. Pull requests should normally be made to this branch.
-  * Bug fixes may be submitted to older `dev-vX` branches. When doing this, the
-    same (or an equivalent) fix should also be submitted to all subsequent
-    `dev-vX` branches.
-  * A `release-vX` branch holds the most recent stable release for major version
-    `X`.
-
-#### Using Android Studio ####
-
-To develop ExoPlayer using Android Studio, simply open the ExoPlayer project in
-the root directory of the repository.
+There are two modifications to this lib from the standard version, at the time of writing. The first enables the duration to be set for dynamic length playlists, the second allows normal seeking behaviour for live playlists.
