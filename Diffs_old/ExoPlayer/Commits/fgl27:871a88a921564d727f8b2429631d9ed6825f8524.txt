 * Add `PlaybackStatsListener` to collect `PlaybackStats` for playbacks analysis
   and analytics reporting (TODO: link to developer guide page/blog post).
 * Add basic DRM support to the Cast demo app.
-* Add `ResolvingDataSource` for just-in-time resolution of `DataSpec`s

+* Offline: Add `Scheduler` implementation that uses `WorkManager`.
 * Assume that encrypted content requires secure decoders in renderer support

 * Decoders: Prefer decoders that advertise format support over ones that do not,
   even if they are listed lower in the `MediaCodecList`.
-* CEA-608: Handle XDS and TEXT modes
-  ([#5807](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/5807)).
-* Audio:
- * Fix an issue where not all audio was played out when the configuration
-   for the underlying track was changing (e.g., at some period transitions).
- * Add `SilenceMediaSource` that can be used to play silence of a given
-   duration ([#5735](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/5735)).
