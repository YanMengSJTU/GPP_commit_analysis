+# Doppl Info

+We have a very early but functional version. Realm is moving pretty fast, so I'd need to check in again, but at the time of development, Realm was modifying data objects at the class level rather than source, which is what we need for j2objc. Using Spoon we can affect similar changes and have a functional version of realm working. However, it needs some serious effort to get it to a production ready state.
