 ## Disabling card.io card scanning

 Single Payments can be configured to accept credit cards through manual entry, but without card scanning.  To do so, remove the same libs above, and remove `android.permission.CAMERA` and `android.permission.VIBRATE` permissions from `AndroidManifest.xml`.  If you wish to disable credit card support altogether, follow the above steps to reduce the permissions and sdk footprint, and add the following to the `PayPalConfiguration` initialization:

-## Dependency Conflicts
-
-The Android SDK is built on top of the [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org/) library included within Android.  This can lead to a conflict if you provide your own copy of either Apache's [httpclient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/index.html), [httpcore](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-4.3.x/index.html), or a package that depends on either of these, such as [httpmime](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/httpmime/project-reports.html).  To resolve this, you must use [httpclient-android](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/android-port.html) instead of httpcore and httpclient.  The following example is the Android equivalent of the httpmime, httpcore, and httpclient dependencies:
-
-```
-compile ('org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient-android:4.3.5')
-compile ('org.apache.httpcomponents:httpmime:4.3.6') {
-    exclude(group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents', module: 'httpclient')

 PayPal Android SDK release notes
 ================================
 
+2.11.1
+------
+* Fix crash in `PayPalService.onDestroy()` [#212](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK/issues/212).
+* Fix case where shipping address selections were inadvertently displayed to the user [#213](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK/issues/213).
+* Decrease minSdkVersion back down to 10 (GINGERBREAD_MR1).
+* Convert SampleApp to only use Gradle builds.
+
+2.11.0
+------
+* Target Android 23 (M).
+* Update card.io to 5.1.1 (supports new Android 23 Permissions). Note: this version of card.io contains support for more processor archictures.  Please be sure to grab the entire contents of this SDK, including all up-to-date card.io `*.so` files within the `/libs` folder to ensure that card.io will continue to work on these architectures.
+* Increase minSdkVersion to 11 (HONEYCOMB).
+* Update all networking to use HttpURLConnection instead of Apache's HTTP Client.
+* Set all obfuscated classes to use lower case as a workaround for [an Android Tools issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=187210).
+
 2.10.1
 ------
 * Minor bug fixes.
