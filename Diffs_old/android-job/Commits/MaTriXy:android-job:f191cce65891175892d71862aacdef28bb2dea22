+### Can I run a job immediately?
+
+No, it's recommended to extract the logic from your job instead and to reuse it in a background thread.
+
+```java
+public class JobSample extends Job {
+
+    @NonNull
+    @Override
+    protected Result onRunJob(Params params) {
+        runNow();
+        return Result.SUCCESS;
+    }
+
+    public static void runNow() {
+        new MyAwesomeTask().run();
+    }
+
+    public static class MyAwesomeTask {
+        public void run() {
+            // do stuff here
+        }
+    }
+}
+```
+
+### How can I run a job at a specific time once a day?
+
+See this sample, which schedules a job between 1 AM and 6 AM each day. Note that this sample isn't using a periodic job, because the periodic jobs don't support a flex parameter (yet).
+
+```java
+public class JobSample extends Job {
+
+    public static final String TAG = "JobSample";
+
+    public static void schedule() {
+        schedule(true);
+    }
+
+    private static void schedule(boolean updateCurrent) {
+        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
+        int hour = calendar.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
+        int minute = calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE);
+
+        // 1 AM - 6 AM, ignore seconds
+        long startMs = TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(60 - minute)
+                + TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis((24 - hour) % 24);
+        long endMs = startMs + TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(5);
+
+        new JobRequest.Builder(TAG)
+                .setExecutionWindow(startMs, endMs)
+                .setPersisted(true)
+                .setUpdateCurrent(updateCurrent)
+                .build()
+                .schedule();
+    }
+
+    @NonNull
+    @Override
+    protected Result onRunJob(Params params) {
+        try {
+            // do something
+            return Result.SUCCESS;
+        } finally {
+            schedule(false); // don't update current, it would cancel this currently running job
+        }
+    }
+}
+```
