 # Android-Job
 
-An utility library for Android to run jobs delayed in the background. Depending on the Android version either the `JobScheduler`, `GcmNetworkManager` or `AlarmManager` is getting used. You can find out in [this blog post](https://blog.evernote.com/tech/2015/10/26/unified-job-library-android/) or [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/vrallev/scheduling-background-job-on-android-at-the-right-time) why you should prefer this library than each separate API. All features from Android Nougat are backward compatible.

-The library doesn't use reflection, but it relies on two `Service`s and two `BroadcastReceiver`s. In order to avoid any issues, you shouldn't obfuscate those four classes.
