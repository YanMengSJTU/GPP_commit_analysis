 ### Why can't an interval be smaller than 15 minutes for periodic jobs?
 
-This library is a subset of 3 different APIs. Since Android Nougat the minimum interval of periodic jobs is 15 minutes. Although pre Nougat devices support a smaller intervals, the least common was chosen as minimum for this library so that all devices behave the same for all APIs.

 The `JobScheduler` with Android Nougat allows setting a smaller interval, but the value is silently adjusted and a warning is being logged. This library throws an exception instead, so that misbehaving jobs are caught early.
