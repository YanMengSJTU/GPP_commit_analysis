+A fast dependency injector for Java and Android.
 
-## About Google's Fork
+Dagger is a compile-time framework for dependency injection. It uses no
+reflection or runtime bytecode generation, does all its analysis at
+compile-time, and generates plain Java source code.
 
-Dagger 2 is a compile-time evolution approach to dependency injection.
-Taking the approach started in Dagger 1.x to its ultimate conclusion,
-Dagger 2.x eliminates all reflection, and improves code clarity by
-removing the traditional ObjectGraph/Injector in favor of user-specified
-`@Component` interfaces.
-
-This github project represents the Dagger 2 development stream.  The earlier
-[project page][square] (Square, Inc's repository) represents the earlier 1.0
-development stream. Both versions have benefited from strong involvement from
-Square, Google, and other contributors.
-
-Dagger is currently in active development, primarily internally at Google,
-with regular pushes to the open-source community. Snapshot releases are
-auto-deployed to sonatype's central maven repository on every clean build with
-the version `HEAD-SNAPSHOT`.
