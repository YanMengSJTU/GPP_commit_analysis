+## Building Dagger
+
+Dagger is built with [`bazel`](https://bazel.build).
+
+### Building Dagger from the command line
+
+*   [Install Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)
+*   Build the Dagger project with `bazel build <target>`
+    *   Learn more about Bazel targets [here][bazel targets].
+    *   If you see an error similar to `ERROR: missing input file
+        '@androidsdk//:build-tools/26.0.2/aapt'`, install the missing build
+        tools version with the android `sdkmanager` tool.
+*   Run tests with `bazel test <target>`, or `bazel build //...` to run all
+    tests
+*   You can install the Dagger libraries in your **local maven repository** by
+    running the `./util/install-local-snapshot.sh` script.
+    *   It will build the libraries and install them with a `LOCAL-SNAPSHOT`
+        version.
+
+[bazel targets]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/build-ref.html
+
+### Importing the Dagger project in IntelliJ/Android Studio
+
+*   Visit `Preferences > Plugins` in the IDE menu.
+    *   Search for `bazel` and install the plugin.
+    *   If no result shows up, click on `Search in repositories`, search for
+        `bazel` and install the plugin.
+*   Select `Import Bazel Project`.
+*   Input the path to the Dagger project under `workspace`, click `Next`.
+*   Select `Generate from BUILD file`, type `BUILD` in the `Build file` input,
+    click `Next`.
+*   [Android Studio only] In the `Project View` form, uncomment one of the
+    `android_sdk_platform` lines. Pick one that you have installed, then click
+    `Finish`.
+*   If you get an error on Bazel sync, `Cannot run program "bazel"`, then:
+    *   In the command line, run `where bazel` and copy the output  (e.g.
+        `/usr/local/bin/bazel`)
+    *   In Android Studio, go to `Preferences > Bazel Settings` and replace
+        `Bazel binary location` with what you just copied.
+*   Note that the first sync can take a long time. When build files are changed,
+    you can run partial syncs (which should be faster) from the file menu.
+*   [Android Studio only] To view the Dagger project structure, open the
+    `Project` view and switch the top selector from `Android` to `Project`.
