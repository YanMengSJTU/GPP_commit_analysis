+# How to contribute
 
-If you would like to contribute code to Dagger you can do so through GitHub by
-forking the repository and sending a pull request.
+We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
+just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
 
-When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
-and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
+## Contributor License Agreement
 
-Please make sure your code compiles by running `mvn clean verify` which will
-execute both unit and integration test phases.  Additionally, consider using
-http://travis-ci.org to validate your branches before you even put them into
-pull requests.  All pull requests will be validated by Travis-ci in any case
-and must pass before being merged.
+Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
+Agreement. This is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even
+after your contribution becomes part of this project. So this agreement simply
+gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
+project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current
+agreements on file or to sign a new one.
 
-If you are adding or modifying Dagger code and would like to add your name to
-the copyright, modify the `AUTHORS` file. All files are released with the
-Apache 2.0 license.
+You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
+(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
+again.
 
-Before your code can be accepted into the project you must sign the
-[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][CLA].
+## Code reviews
 
+All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
+use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
+information on using pull requests.
