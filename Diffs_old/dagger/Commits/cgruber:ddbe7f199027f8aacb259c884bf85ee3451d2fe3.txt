 Documentation
 -------------
 
-The Dagger project will undergo a documentation re-vamp in preparation for 2.0.  In the mean-time,
-you can get an initial picture of Dagger 2.0's direction from [the original proposal][proposal],
-[this talk by Greg Kick][gaktalk], and discussions on the dagger-discuss@googlegroups.com 
-mailing list.
+You can [find the dagger documentation here][website] which has extended usage
+instructions and other useful information.  Substantial usage information can be
+found in the [API documentation][20api].
 
-Also, Javadocs are updated on every merge and are [available here][latestapi]
+You can also learn more from [the original proposal][proposal], 
+[this talk by Greg Kick][gaktalk], and on discussions on the dagger-discuss@googlegroups.com
+mailing list. 
 
 Installation
 --------
 
-You will need to include the `dagger-${dagger.version}.jar` in your
-application's runtime.  In order to activate code generation you will need to
-include `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.
