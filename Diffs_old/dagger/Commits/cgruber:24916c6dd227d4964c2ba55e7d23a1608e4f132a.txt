 About Google's Fork
 -------------
 
-This project represents Google's fork of [Square's Dagger][upstream].
-Google's Dagger fork is intended to vary from Square's project only where features are
-needed to deviate from Square's feature-set.  Google's Dagger should be a drop-in compatible
-alternative to Square's Dagger, and many features in this fork will, if successful, be
-merged into the upstream project.  
+Dagger 2.0 is a completely compile-time evolution of the Dagger approach to dependency injection,
+eliminating all reflection, and moving towards user-specified access to managed graphs (vs.
+the traditional Context/Injector/ObjectGraph found in earlier dependency-injection frameworks.
+
+This github project represents the Dagger 2.0 development stream.  The earlier 
+[project page][square] (Square, Inc's repository) represents the earlier 1.0 development stream.  
+Both versions have benefitted from strong involvement from Square, Google, and other contributors. 
 
-Efforts are made to also keep Google's fork as close in structure to Square's as possible,
-to facilitate merging and compatibility.  Google/dagger will release shortly after Square's
-releases.
+Status

-Differences with square/dagger
-------------------------------
+***Version:* 2.0-SNAPSHOT** 
 
-  * Injectable types with inheritance hierarchies are scanned at compile time and adapters are generated for their parent types statically.  This differs from square/dagger which always falls back to reflection for the parent types
-    * Pro: Reflection can be entirely avoided in an application.
-    * Con: Changes to parent types to add or remove @Inject members require that this class' adapter be regenerated
-    * Con: Extra code is generated for each concrete sub-type which generates its own copy of the parent adapter (since we don't rely on the parent type having had InjectAdapterProcessor run over it)
+Dagger is currently in active development, primarily internally at Google, with regular pushes
+to the open-source community.  Snapshot releases are auto-deployed to sonatype's central maven
+repository on a clean build with the version tag `2.0-SNAPSHOT`.
 
+Dagger 2.0 is pre-alpha and should be used with caution, though it is usable.  Stable 
+pre-releases will be made as stable points in 2.0's development occur.
+
+Documentation
+-------------
+
+The Dagger project will undergo a documentation re-vamp in preparation for 2.0.  In the mean-time,
+you can get an initial picture of Dagger 2.0's direction from [the original proposal][proposal],
+[this talk by Greg Kick][gaktalk], and discussions on the dagger-discuss@googlegroups.com 
+mailing list.
+
+Also, Javadocs are updated on every merge and are [available here][latestapi]
 
 Installation
 --------
 
-You will need to include the `dagger-${dagger.version}.jar` in your
-application's runtime.  In order to activate code generation you will need to
-include `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.
