 A crash reporting feature for android apps is native since Android 2.2 (FroYo) but only available through the official Android Market (and with limited data). ACRA is a great help for Android developers :
 
   * [developer configurable user interaction](http://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/AdvancedUsage#wiki-User_Interaction): silent reports, Toast notification, status bar notification + dialog or direct dialog
-  * usable with ALL versions of Android from 2.2 onwards.
+  * usable with ALL versions of Android supported by the official support libraries.
   * more [detailed crash reports](http://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/ReportContent) about the device running the app than what is displayed in the Android Market developer console error reports
   * you can [add your own variables content or debug traces](http://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/AdvancedUsage#wiki-Adding_your_own_variables_content_or_traces_in_crash_reports) to the reports
   * you can send [error reports even if the application doesn't crash](http://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/AdvancedUsage#wiki-Sending_reports_for_caught_exceptions)
