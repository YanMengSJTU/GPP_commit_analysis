 > Scaning barcodes to clipboard in Android

 ## Rationale
 
 There are many barcode reader apps out there in the PlayStore, but none provides an easy way to scan "multiple" barcodes. This app will just let you keep scanning barcodes as long as your heart's content while keeping all the scan history right into your phone's clipboard ready to be pasted anywhere.
