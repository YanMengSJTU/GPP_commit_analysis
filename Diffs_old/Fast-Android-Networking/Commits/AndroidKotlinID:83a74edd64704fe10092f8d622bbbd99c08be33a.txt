 Fast Android Networking Library takes care of each and everything. So you don't have to do anything, just make request and listen for the response.
 
 ### Why use Fast Android Networking ?
-* Recent removal of HttpClient in Android Marshmallow(Android M) made other networking library obsolete.
-* No other single library do each and everything like making request, downloading any type of file, uploading file, loading
-  image from network in ImageView, etc. There are libraries but they are outdated.
-* No other library provided simple interface for doing all types of things in networking like setting priority, cancelling, etc.
-* As it uses [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio) , No more GC overhead in android application.
