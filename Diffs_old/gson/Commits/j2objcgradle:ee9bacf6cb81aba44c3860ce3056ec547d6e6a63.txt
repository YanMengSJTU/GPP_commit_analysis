-[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/gson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/gson)
-[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson)
-[![Javadoc](https://javadoc-emblem.rhcloud.com/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/badge.svg)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson)
+This is a fork of the Google Gson library to provide tests and modifications to support 
+iOS development with J2objc using the [Doppl build framework](http://doppl.co/).
 
-Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
-Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. 
+## Versions
 
-There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals. 
+[2.6.2](https://github.com/doppllib/gson-forked-doppl/tree/dp-v2.6.2)
 
-### Gson Goals
-  * Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
-  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
-  * Extensive support of Java Generics
-  * Allow custom representations for objects
-  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)
+## Usage
