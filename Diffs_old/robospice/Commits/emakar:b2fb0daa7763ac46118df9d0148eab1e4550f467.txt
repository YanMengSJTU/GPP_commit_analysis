-
-Version 1.0.0
--------------
-
-* Name changed from Content Manager to RoboSpice
-* published on Github
-* published on Maven Central 
-
-Version 0.0.13
---------------
-
-* minor enhancement of simple requests, exception stack traces were lost.
-
-Version 0.0.12
---------------
-
-* back to previous dependency injection model inside services.
-* content manager is now more robust and more stable
-* dropped the idea of integrating AsyncTasks into the framework.
-* minor enhancements.
-
-
-Version 0.0.11
---------------
-
-* configuration is now entirely mavenized. No libs folder anymore, every dependency is controlled by maven.
-Most dependencies are standard although some of the android dependencies are still missing in maven, in that case,
- developpers will have to create them through mvn import-file goal.
-content-manager-it, the test app can't be used under eclipse yet (as the android configurator is not ready yet) : devs should disable maven nature and add the sample
-as a project in the test app java build path. 
-* various attempts have been made to enable canceling a spring android request but that failed. It's not possible and won't be possible in a near future to cancel a request
-that has started its network connection. That's a real concern but spring android doesn't support this feature yet.
-* mostly released for Samy to give content manager a circuit run.
-
-Version 0.0.10
---------------
-
-* revisited maven configuration for deployment
-
-Version 0.0.9
--------------
-
-* life cycle of the ContentManager has improved
-* InputStream based requests had a logical problem : they were processing InputStream on the UI Thread, and that is prohibited as of HoneyComb (and a bad practice),
-they now process the network stream in the background and offer either a memory stream or file stream to be processed by listeners (who can still delegate the processing
-to an asynctask for buttering).
-* Injection Dependency changed to some more standard option : developpers will have to create an Application Class that will provide ContentService instances all their
-required dependencies.
-
-Version 0.0.8 
--------------
-
-* AndroidManifest check. ContentManager will get sure a ContentService has been declared in manifest
-
-Version 0.0.6
--------------
-
-* changed deploy url
-
-Version 0.0.5
--------------
-
-* async operations for ObjectPersisters are available (and optional)
-* persistence layer cleaning, refactoring and renaming
-* added BigInputStream and SmallInputStream requests
-* added README
-* testing 
-* more cache cleaning methods
-* removed roboguice dependency :(
-* split of spring android and json modules
-
-Version 0.0.4
--------------
-
-* first maven and jenkins integrations
-* renaming of maven artefacts
-* nexus deployment
-* local service binding
-* removed all bundlization stuff
-
-Version 0.0.1 (June 23rd 2012)
-------------------------------
-
-* extracted project from c*t*l*m app
-* gitified project

-RoboSpice is a modular android library that makes writing asynchronous network requests *easy* !
-
-To learn more about RoboSpice in 30 seconds, try [this infographics]
-(https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/master/gfx/RoboSpice-InfoGraphics.png).

-If you want to start using RoboSpice right now, jump to the [Wiki](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/wiki) or the [samples](https://github.com/octo-online/RoboSpice-samples).
-
-The [Wiki](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/wiki) has a fully detailed section to quickly setup you up whether you use Gradle, Maven or ant/eclipse.

-
-Main features of RoboSpice
---------------------------
-* supports Android starting *_from_ SDK version 8 (Froyo / 2.2.x)* 
-* executes network requests **asynchronously** (in a background AndroidService)
-* supports **REST** out of the box (using [Spring Android](http://www.springsource.org/spring-android) or [Google Http Client](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client) or [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)).
-* is strongly typed ! You query webservices using **POJOs** as parameters and you get **POJOs** as request results.
-* enforces no constraints neither on POJOs used for requests nor on Activity classes you use in your projects
-* **caches results** in Json with both [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) or [Jackson2](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20) or [Gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/),
-or [Xml](http://simple.sourceforge.net/), or flat text files, or binary files, even using [ORM Lite](http://ormlite.com/sqlite_java_android_orm.shtml) (still in beta)
-* notifies your activities (or any other context) of the result of the network request **with respect to their lifecycles**.
-* notifies your activities (or any other context) on the **UI Thread**
-* **no memory leaks** at all, like Android Loaders, unlike Android AsyncTasks
-* uses a simple but **robust** exception handling model
-* supports **multi-threading** of request executions
-* is **stable**, **efficient** and designed to respect Android philosophy
-* supports request **cancelling**, request **priorization** and requests  **aggregation**
-* supports aggregation of different web services
-* is a full featured replacement for long running AsyncTasks even if they are not related to networking.
-* is **open source** ;) 
-* and **tested** (more than 200 tests)
-
-RoboSpice is [under Quality control on Sonar's Nemo instance](http://nemo.sonarsource.org/dashboard/index/504442). Thanks to Sonar Source.
