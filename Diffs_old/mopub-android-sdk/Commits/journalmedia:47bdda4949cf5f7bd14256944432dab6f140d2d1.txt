+# Distilled MoPub Integration
+
+This is a fork of the [MoPub Android SDK](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk). It includes customisations for a countdown timer and some minor UI changes.
+
+To build a AAR to include in the Distilled app's:
+
+1. CD into the root folder and run:
+
+    `./gradlew mopub-sdk:build`
+
+You must use JDK7 with gradle for the build to be successful. To force JDK7 run:
+
+    ` ./gradlew -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7._version_.jdk/Contents/Home mopub-sdk:build`
+
+Updating the MoPub library:
+
+1. Add original MoPub SDK remote upstream. Guide [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
+
+2. Sync and merge changes from original master. Guide [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
