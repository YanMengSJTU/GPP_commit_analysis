 Please view the [changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of additions, fixes, and enhancements in the latest release.
 
-- Added support for viewability measurement from AVID (a.k.a. IAS) and Moat.  
-    - **Important:** New dependencies were included in this release; please update your `build.gradle`'s repositories block to include `maven { url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/moat-sdk-builds" }`. See [Upgrading from 4.15.0 and Prior](#upgradeRepositoryViewability) for more details.
+- Added support for viewability measurement from IAS (AVID library) and Moat.  
+    - **Important:** New dependencies were included in this release; please update your `build.gradle`'s repositories block to include `maven { url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/moat-sdk-builds" }`. Note that the AVID library is provided on JCenter, so no additional steps must be taken -- it will be included automatically. See [Upgrading from 4.15.0 and Prior](#upgradeRepositoryViewability) for more details.
     - To disable this feature, see below section on [Disabling Viewability Measurement](#disableViewability).
 - Interstitials are now loaded offscreen instead of in a separate WebView.
 - Rewarded Videos have a new init method. See `MoPubRewardedVideos.initializeRewardedVideo(Activity, List<Class<? extends CustomEventRewardedVideo>>, MediationSettings...)`. Pass in a list of networks to initialize, and MoPub will initialize those networks with the settings from the previous ad request, persisted across app close.
