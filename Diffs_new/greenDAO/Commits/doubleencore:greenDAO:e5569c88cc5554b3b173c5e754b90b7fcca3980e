+Changes on This Fork
+====================
+
+This fork of repo adds one new feature, the ability to give your generated Dao classes extend a parent other than [AbstractDao](DaoCore/src/de/greenrobot/dao/AbstractDao.java). The changes we've made are listed below:
+
+* Added the `superclassDao` field to the Generator [Entity](DaoGenerator/src/de/greenrobot/daogenerator/Entity.java) class.
+..* This field is set to `"AbstractDao"` by default
+..* Getters and Setters for this field we also added
+* Now use `${entity.superclassDao}` instead of AbstractDao in the [Dao Template](DaoGenerator/src-template/dao.ftl) file.
+* We also removed some extra spaces in front of `${property.codeBeforeField}` in the [standard](DaoGenerator/src-template/standard/entity.ftl) and [encryption](DaoGenerator/src-template/encryption/dao.ftl) dao template files, so now they have a 4 space indent like everything else.
\ No newline at end of file
