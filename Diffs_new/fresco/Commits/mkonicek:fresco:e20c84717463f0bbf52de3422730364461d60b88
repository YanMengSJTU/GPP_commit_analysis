-**Test plan (required)**
+What existing problem does the pull request solve?
 
-Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if applicable.
+## Test Plan (required)
 
-Make sure tests pass on Circle CI.
+A good test plan has the exact commands you ran and their output, provides screenshots or videos if the pull request changes UI or updates the website. See [What is a Test Plan?][1] to learn more.  
 
-**Code formatting**
+If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
 
-Look around. Match the style of the rest of the codebase. See also the simple [style guide](https://github.com/facebook/fresco/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style). If you use IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, it should automatically pick up the [code style settings](https://github.com/facebook/fresco/blob/master/.idea/codeStyleSettings.xml).
