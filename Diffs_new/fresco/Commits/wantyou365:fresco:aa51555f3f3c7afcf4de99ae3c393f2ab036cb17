 # Fresco 
 
+iueajkkksj:wq
 Fresco is a powerful system for displaying images in Android applications.
 
 Fresco takes care of image loading and display, so you don't have to. It will load images from the network, local storage, or local resources, and display a placeholder until the image has arrived. It has two levels of cache; one in memory and another in internal storage.
