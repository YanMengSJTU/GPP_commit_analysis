 # Contributing to Fresco
+
 We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
 possible.
 
+## Security bugs
+
+Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on that page and do not file a GitHub issue.
+
+## Pull Requests
+
+We welcome pull requests.
+
+1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. 
+2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
+3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. 
+4. Make sure the test suite passes.
+5. Make sure your code passes lint.
+6. If you haven't already, complete the [Contributor License Agreement](https://code.facebook.com/cla) ("CLA").
+
+## Getting started
+
+In Android Studio, choose `File > Open..`. and select the `fresco` folder.
+
+### Specify a path to the NDK
+
+Fresco uses native code for a few features. To build Fresco you'll need to specify the path to the NDK.
+
+In Android Studio, go to `File > Project Structure` and in the dialog set the `Android NDK location`. Android Studio stores the NDK location in to your `local.properties` file.
+
+### Run a sample app
+
+Select the **Showcase** app and click run:
 
-## Issues  
-We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. 
+![Running a sample Fresco app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/346214/24415877/d48d894c-13da-11e7-8601-09627661de67.png)
 
-When you report an issue the more information the better. Here are some things that will help you get an answer faster:
+You can use the drawer to select one of the demos:
 
-- A *title* as well as a body for the issue.
-- A screenshot or video of the problem
-- Logcat output, if your app is crashing.
-- The format of the affected images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP)
-- Whether the image is an animation
-- Where the images are coming from - network, local file, content provider, asset, or resource.
-- A snippet of the code in question
-- Place code in blocks so that it reads like code:

+
+Now you can change any code in Fresco and see the changes in the app.
+
+Have fun hacking on Fresco! ðŸ˜Ž
+
+## Testing your changes
+
+You can check your code compiles using:
 
 ```
-```java (or xml)
-your code here
-```(terminating backticks)
+cd fresco
+./gradlew assembleDebug
 ```
 
-#### Security bugs
+You can run tests locally using:
 
-Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
-disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
-outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

-## Pull Requests
-We actively welcome your pull requests.
+```
+cd fresco
+./gradlew test
+```
 
-1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. 
-2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
-3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. 
-4. Ensure the test suite passes. 
-5. Make sure your code lints. 
-6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
+Circle CI will run the same tests and report on your pull request.
