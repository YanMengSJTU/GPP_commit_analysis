-### Known Issues. 
-#### 1. Instant Run. 
-Instant-Run seems to prevent Sugar ORM from finding the "table" classes, therefore it cannot create the DB tables if you run the app for the first time 
-
-When running your app for the first time Turn off Instant run once to allow for the DB tables to be created
-You can enable it after the tables have been created. 
-
-To disable Instant-Run in Android Studio: 
-
-``(Preferences (Mac) or Settings (PC) -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Instant Run -> Untick "Enable Instant Run..." )``
