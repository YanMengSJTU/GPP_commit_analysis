+### Sugar Cipher Changes
+
+Add a meta property named ENCRYPTION_KEY in your manifest file along with other Sugar configuration as follows:
+
+        <meta-data android:name="ENCRYPTION_KEY" android:value="<your own key here>" />
+        
+Include the SQLCipher libraries and assets from this link:
+https://s3.amazonaws.com/sqlcipher/SQLCipher+for+Android+v3.1.0.zip
+
+Extract the libs and assets into your application. This dependency is not included in the sugar library.
+
+You're good to go. Use Sugar as usual and your database is encrypted now.
