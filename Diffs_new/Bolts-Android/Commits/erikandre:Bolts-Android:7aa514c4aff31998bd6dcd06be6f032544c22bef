 You can also perform several `Task`s in parallel, using the `whenAll` method. You can start multiple operations at once and use `Task.whenAll` to create a new `Task` that will be marked as completed when all of its input `Task`s are finished. The new `Task` will be successful only if all of the passed-in `Task`s succeed. Performing operations in parallel will be faster than doing them serially, but may consume more system resources and bandwidth.
