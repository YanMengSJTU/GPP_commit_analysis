+To supply the executor, to bind `@Production Executor` in a
 `ProductionComponent` or `ProductionSubcomponent`. This binding will be
 implicitly scoped `@ProductionScope`. For subcomponents, the executor may be
 bound in any parent component, and its binding will be inherited in the
 subcomponent (like all bindings are).

-- Otherwise, the generated builder will have a method `executor(Executor)`.
