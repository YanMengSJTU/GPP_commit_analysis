+### Executor
+
+The primary way to supply the executor is to bind `@Production Executor` in a
+`ProductionComponent` or `ProductionSubcomponent`. For subcomponents, the
+executor may be bound in any parent component, and its binding will be inherited
+in the subcomponent (like all bindings are).

+**This following alternative is deprecated and will be removed soon!**
+
+Alternatively, for a `ProductionComponent`, the executor may be supplied on the
+builder directly:
+
+- If a `ProductionComponent.Builder` is explicitly written, it may have a method
+that takes an `Executor`.
+- Otherwise, the generated builder will have a method `executor(Executor)`.
+
+In this case, if `@ProductionExecutor Executor` is bound, compilation will fail
+with a duplicate binding error.
+
+Note that this means that a `ProductionComponent` that does not specify its
+builder must use this alternative method for supplying the executor.

 ### Component dependencies
 
 Like ordinary `Component`s, `ProductionComponent`s may depend on other
