-Dagger will emit a warning on the parent component if it has a method that
-returns a subcomponent builder that includes a repeated module. You can suppress
-the warning by annotating the builder method (`repeatedModule(RepeatedModule)`),
-the builder type (`ComponentThree.Builder`), the parent component's subcomponent
-method (`componentThreeBuilder()`), or the parent component itself
-(`ComponentOne`) with `@SuppressWarnings("repeated-module")`.
