 ## Replace bindings for functional/integration/end-to-end testing
 
 Functional/integration/end-to-end tests typically use the production
-application, but substitute [fakes] (don’t use mocks in large functional tests!)
-for persistence, backends, and auth systems, leaving the rest of the
+application, but substitute [fakes][fakes] (don’t use mocks in large functional
+tests!) for persistence, backends, and auth systems, leaving the rest of the
 application to operate normally. That approach lends itself to having one (or
 maybe a small finite number) of test configurations, where the test
 configuration replaces some of the bindings in the prod configuration.
