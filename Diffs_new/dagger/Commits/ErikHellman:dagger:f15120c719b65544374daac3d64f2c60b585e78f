+If there is a binding for `CoffeeCozy`, and that binding is `@Nullable`, then it
+is a compile-time error to inject `Optional<CoffeeCozy>`, because `Optional`
+cannot contain `null`. You can always inject the other forms, because `Provider`

 An optional binding that is absent in one component can be present in a
 subcomponent if the subcomponent includes a binding for the underlying type.
