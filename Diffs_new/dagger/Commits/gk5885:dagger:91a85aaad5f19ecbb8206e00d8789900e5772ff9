 ### Module Properties
 
-The primary differences between the two stem from the fact that _graph validation_ is no longer performed on a per-module basis. In Dagger 1 terms, Dagger 2 modules are all declared as `complete = false` and `library = true`, but since that is most permissive for validation those properties and `addsTo` can just be removed when migrating.

 Modules are no longer the mechanism for declaring which types can be accessed by calling code.  So, the `injects` and `staticInjections` properties can be removed as well.
