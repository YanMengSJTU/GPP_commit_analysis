+# Performance & Monitoring
+
+## How do I add tracing to my components?
+
+Dagger does not include a tracing mechnamism for `@Component` implementations â€”
+the runtime cost of monitoring relative to the runtime cost of simple provisions
+would be too great to apply broadly.
+
+If you would still like tracing for debug builds and whatnot, it can be applied
+after compilation using [AOP] bytecode transformations.
+
+`@ProductionComponent`, on the other hand, does have a monitoring API in
+[`dagger.producers.monitoring`].
