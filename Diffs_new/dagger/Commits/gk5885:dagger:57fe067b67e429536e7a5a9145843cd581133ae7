 [Dependency injection][DI] frameworks have existed for years with a whole variety of APIs for configuring and injecting.  So, why reinvent the wheel?  Dagger 2 is the first to **implement the full stack with generated code**. The guiding principle is to generate code that mimics the code that a user might have hand-written to ensure that dependency injection is a simple, traceable and performant as it can be. For more background on the design, watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_XtfXPkqw) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fby5VeGU9CN8zjw4lAb2QPPsKRxx6mSwCe9q7ECNSJQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)) by [+Gregory Kick](https://google.com/+GregoryKick/).
 
 ## Using Dagger
-We'll demonstrate dependency injection and Dagger by building a coffee maker. For complete sample code that you can compile and run, see Dagger's [coffee example](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/master/example/src/main/java/coffee).
