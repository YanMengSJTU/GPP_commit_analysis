+Dagger will emit a warning on the parent component if it has a method that
+returns a subcomponent builder that includes a repeated module. You can suppress
+the warning by annotating the builder method (`repeatedModule(RepeatedModule)`),
+the builder type (`ComponentThree.Builder`), the parent component's subcomponent
+method (`componentThreeBuilder()`), or the parent component itself
+(`ComponentOne`) with `@SuppressWarnings("repeated-module")`.
