+title: ELI5: Dagger
+---
+
+Q: [ELI5 on what Dagger is](reddit)?
+
+A: Instead of taking the toys you want yourself, ask Mommy/Daddy for your toys
+and they'll give them to you. Sometimes you ask for a new Teddy Bear multiple
+times, but Mommy and Daddy give you the same Teddy Bear because you don't know
+the difference between an old one and a new one.
+
+Some play rooms only have certain toys. Before you're ready to play, Mommy and
+Daddy need to bring all of the toys to the room. If you ask for a toy that isn't
+in the room, Mommy and Daddy won't compile your application.
+
+- toys == bindings == `@Inject` contructors/`@Provides` methods
+- Mommy/Daddy/Dagger == `@Component`s
+- TeddyBear == a scoped object, i.e. there exists only one
+- some rooms only have some toys = `@Component`s need to declare what `@Module`s
+  they include
