+title: Unused Modules and Component Dependencies
+---
+
+When the Dagger processor generates components, it only requires instances of
+modules and component dependencies that are explicitly needed to supply requests
+for a binding.
+*   If all of a module's methods that are used in the component are static,
+    Dagger does not need an instance of that module at all. Dagger can invoke
+    the static methods directly without a module.
+*   If a module provides no bindings for a Component, no instance of that module
+    is necessary to construct the graph.
