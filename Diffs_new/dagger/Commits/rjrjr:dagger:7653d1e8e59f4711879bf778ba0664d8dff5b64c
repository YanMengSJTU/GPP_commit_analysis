 /**
  * A handle to a lazily-computed value. Each {@code Lazy} computes its value on
- * the first call to {@code get()} and remembers that same value for all
+ * the first call to {@link #get()} and remembers that same value for all
  * subsequent calls to {@code get()}.
  *
+ * <p>All implementations are expected to be thread-safe and compute their value at most once.
+ *
  * <h2>Example</h2>
  * The differences between <strong>direct injection</strong>, <strong>provider
  * injection</strong> and <strong>lazy injection</strong> are best demonstrated
