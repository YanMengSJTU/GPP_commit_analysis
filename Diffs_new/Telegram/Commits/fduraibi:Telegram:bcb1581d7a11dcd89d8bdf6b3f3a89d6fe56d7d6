+## Telegram Ultra
+This is my fork of Telegram with few changes from the main app:
+
+* Disable trimming of spaces and newlines in messages to preserve the formatting
+* Simple markdown (Bold text, Color)
+* Two options to forward messages (that includes text, video, photo, docs ....etc):
+    - With original sender's name (like original app) "Quoted forwarding"
+    - Without the original sender's name (will carry your name only) 
+* Fix for many Whatsapp emoji which don't translate correctly to Telegram emoji
+* Increase of Emoji rendering size from 50 to 200
+* Increase message size from 2k to 4k
+* Show sender's name on videos, photos and documents
