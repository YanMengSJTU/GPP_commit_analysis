-3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
-3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
-4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
