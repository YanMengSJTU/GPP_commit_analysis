-## Telegram messenger for Android
+## nonflatgram
 
-[Telegram](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free.
-This repo contains the official source code for [Telegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger).
+*A flat paper plane simply does not fly.*
 
-##Creating your Telegram Application
+This is an experimental project for a Telegram client for Android, that incorporates all the features and bug fixes of the Official Telegram Client for Android by DrKLO, but that does not follow the (IMHO quite ugly) Google Material Design.
 
-We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
-There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
+### About Telegram
 
-1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
-2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
-3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
-3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
-4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
+[Telegram](https://www.telegram.org/) is a messaging platform focused on speed and security. It's super fast, simple and free.
