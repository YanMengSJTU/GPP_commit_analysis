 ### Project description
 
 The project is about to build a messaging system that help users groups in taking decision, providing an in-app fully integrated support to this process. Basically the system that i will build is based on democratic vote, where each user can make proposal that will be voted by others, as vote system seems to works kind of good for finding consensus in a democratic systems,since the 6th century BC.
