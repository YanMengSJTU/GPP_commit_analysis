-## Telegram messenger for Android
+## [LaPrimaire.org](https://laprimaire.org) — LaPrimaire.org Android App
 
-[Telegram](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free.
-This repo contains the official source code for [Telegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger).
+[LaPrimaire.org](https://laprimaire.org) aims at crowdsourcing the next french President through the first open democratic primary:
 
-##Creating your Telegram Application
+* **Democratic** because anybody can be a candidate
+* **Open** because the primary in itself does not defend any ideology and is open to all ideas that comply to the law
 
-We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
-There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
+Obviously, due to the scale of the primary, it can only happen online and this is why we developed a Telegram bot to guide participating citizens through the primary. As we created a Telegram bot, we could just have asked participating citizens to download, install Telegram and then contact our bot but, given that a lot of citizens are not computer savvy at all (to say the least) we though it might be a good idea not to confuse them by having to explain to them what Telegram is.
 
-1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
-2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
-3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
-3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
-4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
+This is why we decided to make a mini-fork of [Telegram Messenger for Android App](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram). What's a mini-fork ? It is a fork that only bring cosmetic changes and will never diverge a lot from the upstream Telegram Android App. Our goal was not to add or remove features from Telegram Android App but to provide citizens with a more natural and straightforward on-boarding flow to the Telegram bot.
