 It is true that could be also possible to achieve task similar to the ones performed by Decisiongram, by sending in a Telegram group chat something the link to a Doodle, or to a shared Google spreadsheet. But with using Decisiongram, according to the way it is implemented, the task of making a decision will be performed in a much more easy way and with a better support, for the following reasons.
 
-1. Notification about decisions, will be reported, with special messages, just inside the chat thread, making so those transaction, part of the communication between group members.
-2. Decisiongram as it is based on Telegram, is primarily a Messaging app, so moreover than providing support for voting options, it even provide a natural support for discussing about that, helping so in finding consensus.
-3. If different decision are created in the same group, it not necessary to add each time all the members, cause decision's members are exactly the same as the group members.
-4. As the poll will be created right inside a preexisting group of users (the group-chat) it will be easy to see who answered and who didn't; making so easy to remind group's members to vote, if they didn’t.
-5. If the decision space (number of members and number of options) is large could be pretty hard, using software like Doodle, figure out what are the options that actually have the highest likelihood of being chosen, as for doing so, it will be necessary to scroll through all the decision space. Decisiongram shows you the options ordered by positive vote count, in this way it’s easy to have a clear vision of the options that have highest likelihood of being chosen. So the last users that vote could be somehow influenced, by the one that voted before; this conditioning could be helpful in order to reach a widest agreement, on the populars options. Anyway options with less votes are not hidden they are just moved down in the list.
-6. It is possible to describe deeply a decision or an option by adding a description, that can even contains URLs.
-7. Having everything integrated in the same app, will make for the user easier to switch between the chat and the poll; removing so the friction of opening another app or the web-browser, that may even required to sign in or to sign up in order to access the poll.

+### App deployment

+For Android app the natural way for doing so is publishing it on the Google Play Store. I tried to do so, but unfortunately I am having some issues, as Google suspended my app because it violates the impersonation and intellectual property provision. So they asked me to send them some proof that Telegram authorizes me to publishing Decisiongram. I wrote to the Telegram support team, but at the moment I am still waiting for an answer.
