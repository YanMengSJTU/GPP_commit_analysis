+[PWRTelegram](https://pwrtelegram.xyz/pwrtelegram-app) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free.
+This repo contains the official source code for the [PWRTelegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.pwrtelegram.messenger).
 
-##Creating your Telegram Application
+Also do check out the [PWRTelegram bot API: a boosted version of telegram's bot API that can upload/download files up to 1.5 GB, supports anonymous downloads and much more!](https://pwrtelegram.xyz).  
 
-We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
-There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
+The PWRTelegram app is a fork of the official Telegram messenger app that can login as a bot.  
+You just need to provide the bot token and you will be able to receive all of the messages your bot receives or sends to its groups or users.  
+Once you login you won’t get a dialog list, but when a user sends you a message it will be received and the chat will be created.  
+This app is still in beta state, if you notice any bug report it to the [official PWRTelegram group](https://telegram.me/pwrtelegamgroup) by sending an accurate description of the problem with the logs (settings->send logs).
