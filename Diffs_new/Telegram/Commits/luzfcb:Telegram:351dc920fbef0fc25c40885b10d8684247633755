+### Translation
+
+
+Sirs translators, It was becoming impossible to manage all pull requests regarding translations. This was also taking the precious time to fix bugs. A translated program is good, but is better a program with less or no bugs, and more features. We decided then, fully migrate any translation effort to Transifex translation platform. 
+
+The Transifex platform makes it much simpler to manage groups of translations and translations, and has several well useful tools for this purpose. 
+
+We thank everyone for their arduous effort.
+
+See [Telegram] (http://telegram.org) translation project on Transifex platform here:

+
+If your language is not yet available, make the request for inclusion in [Transifex.com platform] (Https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/telegram)
+
+All pull requests on GitHub, regarding translations will not be accepted.
