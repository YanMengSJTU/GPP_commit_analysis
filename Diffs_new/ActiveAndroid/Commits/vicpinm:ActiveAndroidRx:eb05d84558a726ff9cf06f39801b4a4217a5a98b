-# ActiveAndroid
+# ActiveAndroidRx
 
-ActiveAndroid is an active record style ORM ([object relational mapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)). What does that mean exactly? Well, ActiveAndroid allows you to save and retrieve SQLite database records without ever writing a single SQL statement. Each database record is wrapped neatly into a class with methods like _save()_ and _delete()_.
+ActiveAndroid fork witch includes SQLBrite from Square (https://github.com/square/sqlbrite) to get reactive queries.
 
-ActiveAndroid does so much more than this though. Accessing the database is a hassle, to say the least, in Android. ActiveAndroid takes care of all the setup and messy stuff, and all with just a few simple steps of configuration.
+## Usage
